ðŸ”¹ From Data to Decisions â€“ My Tableau Dashboard Journey ðŸ”¹

I recently designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore Sales Dataset to explore and visualize key business insights.

Hereâ€™s what I built and analyzed:
âœ… Line Chart â€“ Sales performance trends over time
âœ… Pie Chart â€“ Category & segment contribution to revenue
âœ… Bar Chart â€“ Regional and sub-category comparison
âœ… Scatter Plot â€“ Relationship between Profit & Sales

Through this project, I learned how to:
ðŸ“Œ Transform raw data into meaningful insights
ðŸ“Œ Highlight business KPIs with simple & clear visuals
ðŸ“Œ Build dashboards that support data-driven decision making

âœ¨ Tools Used: Tableau, Excel
âœ¨ Skills Applied: Data Analysis | Data Visualization | Business Insights | Storytelling with Data


Iâ€™m excited to keep exploring more real-world datasets and improve my analytical skills.
