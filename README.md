 From Data to Decisions – My Tableau Dashboard Journey 

I recently designed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore Sales Dataset to explore and visualize key business insights.

Here’s what I built and analyzed:
 Line Chart – Sales performance trends over time
 Pie Chart – Category & segment contribution to revenue
 Bar Chart – Regional and sub-category comparison
 Scatter Plot – Relationship between Profit & Sales

Through this project, I learned how to:
 Transform raw data into meaningful insights
 Highlight business KPIs with simple & clear visuals
 Build dashboards that support data-driven decision making

 Tools Used: Tableau, Excel
 Skills Applied: Data Analysis | Data Visualization | Business Insights | Storytelling with Data


I’m excited to keep exploring more real-world datasets and improve my analytical skills.
